This project is by no means intended to function as financial advice. It is just a fun way to track down potentially fraudulent price increases (eg. by means of pump-and-dump), by combining an emotional analysis of the surge in articles (as an indicator commotion), next to various financial indicators, pointing to the purchase volume and the volatility of the crypto.

Again: all stock markets are precarious, to a degree that I am not qualified to assess. Let alone the crypto market, which is mostly ran by semi-literate half-broke finance bros.

Watching the candlesticks move up and down and change colours is fun. Trying to predict which direction they will take is even more fun.

Losing several hundered euros on a crypto which is called "Joy", "Happiness", "Prosperity" or "Optimism" is not fun at all.

I mean, to experience it. To watch something like that happen to someone else is super fun.

Anyway, I do this for the practice and the 'told-you-so's. Not for you to lose your money.

Consider yourself warned. Now, go kids, play around!





(Wow, wow, wow, just before you go! In order to protect yourselves, the implementation I am running uses local authentication. This means that, in order to input and access data, you need to have SSMS installed, and a database promptly named "models"- and not "model"; that already exists. I know because I got the gift. Remember to replace my device name with yours, and to make sure that SSMS is set to local authentication! Otherwise, just make sure that you're adjusting the pyODBC commands properly, to ensure appropriate implementation. If you're not savvy with databases, become savvy with databases before even addressing me. Gendered b-word.)
