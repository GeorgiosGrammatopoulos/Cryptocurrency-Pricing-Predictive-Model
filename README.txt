This project is by no means intended to function as financial advice. All stock markets are precarious, to a degree that I am not qualified to assess. Let alone stock markets which are ran by semi-literate half-broke finance bros.

Watching the candlesticks move up and down and change colours is fun. Trying to predict which direction they will take is even more fun.

Losing several hundered euros on a crypto which is called "Joy", "Happiness", "Prosperity" or "Optimism" is not fun at all.

I mean, to experience it. To watch something like that happen to someone else is super fun.

Anyway, I do this for the practice and the 'told-you-so's. Not for you to lose your money.

Consider yourself warned. Now, have fun!
