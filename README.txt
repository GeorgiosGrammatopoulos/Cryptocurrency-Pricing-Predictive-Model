This project is by no means intended to function as financial advice. It is just a fun way to track down potentially fraudulent price increases (eg. by means of pump-and-dump), by combining an emotional analysis of the surge in articles (as an indicator commotion), next to various financial indicators, pointing to the purchase volume and the volatility of the crypto.

Again: all stock markets are precarious, to a degree that I am not qualified to assess. Let alone the crypto market, which is mostly ran by semi-literate half-broke finance bros.

Watching the candlesticks move up and down and change colours is fun. Trying to predict which direction they will take is even more fun.

Losing several hundered euros on a crypto which is called "Joy", "Happiness", "Prosperity" or "Optimism" is not fun at all.

I mean, to experience it. To watch something like that happen to someone else is super fun.

Anyway, I do this for the practice and the 'told-you-so's. Not for you to lose your money.

Consider yourself warned. Now, go kids, play around!
